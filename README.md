# Profiling Statistics

Statistical software developed in Python (statistical calculations), C++, Qt Creator (Graphic User Interface). 
The main objective of this App is to provide relevant and critical data in a very efficient way, data that can be used to represent  tendencies that the reflow baking process at PLEXUS Corporation Guadalajara may have. 
This App is capable of expressing whether this process is within the control standards, in order to have a succesful production performance.

Profiling Statistics works by analysing the data inside a PDF document named a "Thermal profile". The .exe prototype is a functional interface capable of interpreting this data and generating the mentioned conclusions. The "thermal profiles" wonÂ´t be uploaded because of a confidential agreement, if necessary a video showing the performance of the app may be provided.
